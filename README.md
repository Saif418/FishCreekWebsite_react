# FishCreekWebsite_react
My first web application using frontend react and backend node.js. It is a fish creek website for vets and animals. How to run this, first download this folder containing all components such as Home page, Navbar, service, askAvet, and a shop page. Also download the node.js folder called server_nodejs. Than first run the nodejs server folder and then open the react project, run the project and go to the contact page to submit a request to contact and my server will log your request. Thats all!
