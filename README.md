# FishCreekWebsite_react
My first web application using frontend react and backend node.js. It is a fish creek website for vets and animals. How to run this, first download this folder containing all components such as Home page, Navbar, service, askAvet, and a shop page. Also download the node.js folder called server_nodejs.
